This project focuses on building a queueing system in JavaScript using Redis and Kue. It involves running a Redis server, performing basic operations with the Redis client, and integrating Redis with Node.js for storing and retrieving data. Iâ€™m learning how to store hash values, handle asynchronous operations, and use Kue to manage queues. The project includes building a basic Express app that interacts with a Redis server and extending it to include queueing functionality.

The development environment for this project is Ubuntu 18.04, using Node.js 12.x and Redis 5.0.7. All files are written in JavaScript with the .js extension, adhering to proper formatting practices. A README.md is included at the root of the project directory. By the end of this project, I aim to confidently explain how to set up and implement a queueing system using Redis and Kue without relying on external references.
